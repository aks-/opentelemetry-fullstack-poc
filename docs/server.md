# OpenTelemetry Fullstack POC Server Documentation

## Introduction

The OpenTelemetry Fullstack POC Server is a backend application designed to work in conjunction with the frontend to demonstrate distributed tracing and monitoring using OpenTelemetry. This documentation provides an overview of the provided server-side code and explains its functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the documentation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

2. Frontend Service: Make sure the corresponding frontend service, "opentelemetry-fullstack-poc-frontend," is running and available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Server-Side Code Overview

The server-side code for the OpenTelemetry Fullstack POC consists of JavaScript code that performs the following tasks:

1. **Setting up Tracing:** It initializes OpenTelemetry tracing for the server and specifies an OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) endpoint for exporting traces.

2. **Middleware:** It defines middleware that adds attributes to traces for incoming requests.

3. **Express Routes:** It sets up routes for handling various HTTP requests, including a sleep operation, external service calls, and error simulations.

4. **Tracing and Error Handling:** It traces specific operations and records exceptions in traces.

Let's break down the code step by step.

### Setting up Tracing

```javascript
require('./server-instrumentation/tracing')('otel-fullstack-poc-server1');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { trace, context } = require('@opentelemetry/api');
// ...
